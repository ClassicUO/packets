# Contribution Guidelines

We appreciate your interest in contributing to this project! Below are some guidelines to ensure smooth collaboration and to streamline the process of getting your contributions incorporated into the project.

## Adding New Packet Structures

We welcome contributions of new packet structures. However, there are some conditions to keep in mind:

- The packets should be already established and consumed by emulators (like the Freeshard/UOG packets) or add new functionality that can be useful in a broad context. 

- When submitting a new packet structure, including a reference implementation is highly recommended. It will increase the chances of your contribution being accepted.

- Not all packets will be accepted if they are too shard-specific, and not reusable outside of that shard. We are looking for contributions that benefit a wide range of emulators and shards.

- You must have explicit approval from the creator of the packet to include it in the project. Alternatively, the packet should be publicly released or available under an open-source license.
